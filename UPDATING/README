Upstream gold contains 2 patches that break Android builds.
With them in place, Android will boot up to init, but then vital
system processes crash on startup, causing the system to reboot
into recovery instantly.

From just a quick look at the patches, it appears they rearrange
the .interp section in a way that confuses some Android specific
tool (soslim?) in a way that causes it to strip the interp section,
causing any dynamically linked application to fail. (This is based
on just a quick look, and could turn out to be wrong.)

Until this is fixed in the right place, reverting those 2 patches
doesn't break things badly.

The files in this directory are:
binutils-break-android*.patch: The commits that break Android

binutils-2.22-revert-patches-breaking-android.patch: Patch reverting
those commits for 2.22 (already applied in this repository)
